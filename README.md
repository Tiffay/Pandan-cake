Task

Your Ah Ma wants you to publish her famous pandan cake recipe on the Internet and she's typed it out for you in this .html document (awww).

She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The pandan cake won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).

Ah Ma's Pandan Cake Recipe

Special tips to ensure Pandan cakes do not collapse:

– Mix the egg white and egg yolk carefully
– Cool the cake in the tin upside down
– Always mix egg whites in a grease-free metal dish and whisk them with super clean whisks


Ingredients
4x egg whites
4x egg yolks
1 teaspoon pandan extract
120 grams of white caster sugar
120 grams of flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of salt
icing sugar

baking paper
round baking tin Ø 23 centimeters


Baking mold tips
A pandan cake is often made in a smooth (chiffon) shape. There are no grooves in it. When you use a chiffon rub the bottom with some butter (not too much) or cover with baking paper. Do not butter the middle part or sides.

This cake is ready in 1.5 hours and it serves 15.

1) Preheat the oven to 160 degrees.
2) Mix the 4 egg yolks on the highest setting until it foams well and is lighter in color. Mix pandan extract in (about 1 teaspoon).
3) Mix egg whites (with clean whisks) on half setting until it forms weak peaks. Spoon the sugar into the mix spoon by spoon. Mix every spoon of sugar until completely disappeared on the highest speed setting. Mix until the egg whites form peaks that stay upright when taking the whisks out.
4) Spoon (or fold) the egg yolk slowly through the egg white with a spatula (do not use a mixer anymore).
5) Mix flour, salt, and baking powder. Spoon the flour mix through the batter by sieving a small amount each time.
6) Spoon the batter into the mold and go through the batter with the spatula criss-cross to get the big bubbles out. Bake for 30 minutes at 160 degrees Celsius in the oven
7) Test with a satay stick to see if the cake is baked. If the satay stick comes out clean, take the cake out immediately
8) Cool the cake upside down; this is an essential part of any successful sponge cake. If you don’t, the chance that it will collapse during cooling is high.
9) Let the cake cool for half an hour.
10) Cut the cake out carefully with a butter knife.
